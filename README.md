## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](https://github.com/AlesyaSuperfin/To-do-list/blob/main/src/toDoList.jpg)

I created a ToDo List with kid's design to learn how to work with React, and for my children who like create daily tasks-list.

* I learned how to work with class components in React, access information from input and change the state of an object.
* The project is based on React.
* The application shows today's date.
* Cute design for children and friendly interface.
